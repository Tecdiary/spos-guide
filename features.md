# Features

SimplePOS makes it easy to manage your products, customers, inventory and expense. You can set up product-specific settings like taxes and get detailed reports. It also simplifies ordering products from suppliers by letting you create orders based on your current stock levels and desired quantities.

Our goal is to save you time. We focus on smart automation to reduce manual tasks, minimize mistakes, and streamline the client experience, all with fewer people at the front desk.

We believe the best interface is one you don't have to think about. That's why we focus on fast, easy-to-use workflows without unnecessary clutter. While most POS software is outdated, we simplify things so you can do more with less effort.
